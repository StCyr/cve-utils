# Introduction

This repository contains a collection of tools aimed at identifying CVE applicable to softwares.

`soft2cpe.pl`   tries to translate a software name, together with an optional 
                vendor name and version, into an existing CPE entry.
                
`cve-search.pl` Uses the https://www.circl.lu/services/cve-search/ service 
                to try and find CVE applicable to a given CPE entry
                
`wrapper.pl`    Given a software inventory in .csv format, wrapper.pl will parse
                it and use soft2cpe.pl and cve-search.pl to try to find CVE 
                applicable to software in your inventory.
